# Code Quiz

## Description

This project is a code quiz that I made from scratch. When you first visit the page, there is a start quiz button, and when this button is clicked, the quiz begins. You are then given a series of questions that you have to answer, and every correct and incorrect answer is tracked. After answering all 5 questions, you are then taken to a results screen and you can choose to either quit the quiz or restart it.
